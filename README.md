Our Assignment in CS 2060 was to:

> "Create a game using the NCurses library"

This project was completed in a three week span for the final project for my C programming class.

> "Space Pinball"

Written in C and the NCurses 3rd party library, Space Pinball is a console game from out of this world! The game uses ASCII characters to render the game.
